- (1) Checkout Times for Users
This chart shows the tripduration usage of the bikes, for which four hours to seven hours are the highest durations that the bikes are being used. 

- (2) Checkout Times by Gender
This chart is a deeper dive of the Checkout Times for Users chart, in which we could see that the male usage is much higher than the female and unknown bikers. The male biker usage is consistent with the result from the Checkout Times for Users chart, in which four hours to seven hours are the highest durations. But for the female biker usage, the top tripduration is split fairly evenly between four hours to nine hours. The unknown bikes have a fairly consistent throughout all the duration periods. 

- (3) Trips by Weekday for Each Hour
This chart shows that the bikes are more being used between 10am to 5pm during weekends. During the week, the peak usage is landing between 7am to 9am and 5pm to 8pm. 

- (4) Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
This chart is a deeper dive into the Trips by Weekday for Each Hour chart. The resulting split between male and female bikers is consistent with the above. But the unknown bike usage is fairly even across all periods. 

- (5) User Trips by Gender by Weekday
From this chart, we can see that there are more subscribers than customers. Male and female bikers are mostly subscribers, whereas, unknown bikers are mostly customers. 

- (6) Trips by Location
From this chart, we can tell that most usage is happening in areas below Central Park. 

- (7) Trips by Birth Year
This bar chart shows people who were born in 1969 are the biggest group that bikes the most. Secondary the majority of usage is from bikers who were born between 1988 to 1993. 

## (3) Summary    
In conclusion, the majority of the data is driven by male subscriber bikers who were born in 1969 and between 1988 to 1993. They are actively using the bikes in areas between Central Park in New York, usually during the peak hours of the week and afternoon on the weekends. 

It would be helpful to add two more map charts to show the usage of gender per location and birth year per location. These maps would be helpful in the coming strategy of attracting more users in the lower usage areas.
